      <title>Younger kids workshop</title>
      <link>https://2018.southdakotacodecamp.com/schedule/youth/kids-track-1/</link>

      <guid>https://2018.southdakotacodecamp.com/schedule/youth/kids-track-1/</guid>
      <description>Recommended for 5th grade and younger.
This workshop will focus on using Ozobot&amp;rsquo;s and Sphero&amp;rsquo;s to navigate mazes that the kids will make. We will use a combination of manual control and programming to make the bots run the maze. This will be a free running workshop that will last the entire morning (instead of the normal 50 minute sessions).
This will be a parent + kid track, where parents are expected to attend with their child.</description>

      <link>https://2018.southdakotacodecamp.com/schedule/youth/kids-track-2/</link>

      <guid>https://2018.southdakotacodecamp.com/schedule/youth/kids-track-2/</guid>
      <description>Recommended for 6th grade and older.
In this workshop we will be learning about Intellectual Property, internal workings of a computer, and learning some basic commands to code for three different coding languages. For each language we will have a starting program that the kids will modify to meet the goal. We are working with the Boy Scouts of America to make this quality for the programming merit badge! This will be a free running workshop that will last the entire morning (instead of the normal 50 minute sessions).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer with Raven Industries working on connected solutions and infrastructure. Shortly after the initial release of Docker I started working to &amp;ldquo;containerize all the things.&amp;rdquo; Outside of work I can commonly be found gaming with my wife, cycling, at the gym, or working on &amp;ldquo;this month&amp;rsquo;s inspiration.&amp;rdquo; (http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/)</description>

      <description>Over the past two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve built a ton of sensors with the ESP8266 microcontroller platform to monitor activities around my house. I have sensors that are currently monitoring the temperature throughout my house plus two freezers in my basement. My garage has a garage door sensor to know if it is open or closed as well as a light sensor, complete with Slack integration for alerts and alarms. To top it off, I need to know when the washing machine completes it&amp;rsquo;s cycle so I monitor the vibrations of both the washer and dryer to know if they are running or not.</description>

      <description>Stop passing on life changing opportunities just because you do not know where it could end.
Many developers are asking “what’s next after software development?”. Many developers pass on opportunities because they do know about the challenges or are fully content with what they are doing.
If you are a developer that is wondering about what’s next after software development in your career path, then this session is for you. In addition, if you are content as a developer, this session will help you understand the other roles better so you could reconsider or appreciate the other roles.</description>
