//
// iOS workaround for fixed site headers
//
// iOS Safari does not allow disabling scroll on certain elements unless that
// element has position fixed. The problem with this is when the off canvas is
// activated the users loses the current location in the main body area because it
// jumps to the top. This css along with some js allows iOS Safari to keep the
// content location.

                position: fixed;
            }
        }
