      <description>Recommended for 5th grade and younger.
This workshop will focus on using Ozobot&amp;rsquo;s and Sphero&amp;rsquo;s to navigate mazes that the kids will make. We will use a combination of manual control and programming to make the bots run the maze. This will be a free running workshop that will last the entire morning (instead of the normal 50 minute sessions).
This will be a parent + kid track, where parents are expected to attend with their child.</description>

      <description>Recommended for 6th grade and older.
In this workshop we will be learning about Intellectual Property, internal workings of a computer, and learning some basic commands to code for three different coding languages. For each language we will have a starting program that the kids will modify to meet the goal. We are working with the Boy Scouts of America to make this quality for the programming merit badge! This will be a free running workshop that will last the entire morning (instead of the normal 50 minute sessions).</description>
